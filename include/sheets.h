 * sheets - SAX-style parser for tabulated data-files.
 * Copyright (C) 2025  <lhearachel@proton.me>
 *
 * This library implements a flavour of tabulated data files and provides a basic interface for
 * consuming individual records SAX-style using variadic-arguments. The parsing of input data is
 * kept to a minimum; the caller has full control over how individual fields within a record are
 * validated and stored.
 *
 * The following rules apply (adapted from RFC 4180):
 *
 *   - Records of data are delimited by a single-character token, hereafter referred to as the
 *     "record-delimiter." Usually, this is a line-break character ("\n").
 *   - The last record in the file may or may not have a terminating record-delimiter.
 *   - The first record may be interpreted as a "header" with the same format as ordinary records.
 *   - Records contain one or more fields separated by a single-character token, hereafter referred
 *     to as the "field-delimiter."
 *     - Each record must contain the same number of fields.
 *     - The field-delimiter must *not* be equivalent to the record-delimiter.
 *     - The last field of a record must *not* be followed by the field-delimiter.
 *   - Fields may or may not be enclosed in a single-character token, hereafter referred to as the
 *     "encloser."
 *     - Fields which contain the record-delimiter, the field-delimiter, or the encloser must be
 *       enclosed.
 *     - If a field is enclosed, then any enclosing-token appearing inside that field must be
 *       escaped by preceding it with another encloser. To illustrate, if the encloser is a
 *       double-quote ('"'):
 *       - '""' represents a field which is an empty string.
 *       - '""""' represents a field which contains a single occurrence of a double-quote.
 *       - '""""""' represents a field which contains a pair of double-quotes.
 *     - If a field is *not* enclosed, then the encloser may not otherwise appear inside the field.
 *
 * For simplicity, a maximum of 64 fields is permitted.

 * If `headerfn` and `recordfn` are specified as NULL, then this routine effectively acts as a basic
 * validator for the tabulated data. Otherwise, `headerfn` will be invoked for the first record
 * taken from the data, and `recordfn` will be invoked for each subsequent record.
