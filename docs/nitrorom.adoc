nitrorom - Interface with Nintendo DS ROM images

SYNOPSIS
--------

[verse]
'nitrorom' [OPTION]... [COMMAND] [ARGUMENT]...

DESCRIPTION
-----------

NitroROM is a program for interfacing with Nintendo DS ROM-files in a variety of
ways. Its primary aims are to provide a reusable tool-suite for developers,
modders, hackers, and reverse-engineering researchers. This tool-suite is
sub-divided into a set of commands which act as programs unto themselves; the
top-level executable acts merely as an access-director to these programs.

For details on each of the commands listed below, refer to their distinct manual
page.

OPTIONS
-------

`-h`::
`--help`::
    View the help-text for the access-director, which provides a summary for
    basic usage.

`-v`::
`--version`::
    Display the NitroROM suite-version and exit.

COMMANDS
--------

`list`::
    Generate a listing of the constituent members of an input ROM-file. The
    output listing will be emitted to standard-output in comma-separated format.

`pack`::
    Construct a Nintendo DS ROM-file from the contents of the input specification
    files.
